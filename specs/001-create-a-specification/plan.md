# Implementation Plan: Zen Tasker

**Branch**: `001-create-a-specification` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/roy/Desktop/Playground/specs/001-create-a-specification/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a simple, single-page task manager called Zen Tasker. The application will be built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, adhering to the principles of minimalism and zero dependencies.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
**Primary Dependencies**: None
**Storage**: N/A (Local session, no persistence)
**Testing**: Manual testing as per quickstart.md
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: Must be a single `index.html` file.
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, single session.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

*   **Minimalism**: Is the design simple and clutter-free? **PASS**
*   **Zero Dependencies**: Is the entire app contained within a single index.html file? **PASS**
*   **Automation**: Is deployment automated? **PENDING** (to be addressed in the implementation phase)

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

├── plan.md              # This file (/plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
└── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/plan command)
```

### Source Code (repository root)
```
# Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)
index.html
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
No research was required for this feature. The technical approach is straightforward and follows the principles of the constitution.

**Output**: research.md

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1.  **Data Model**: The data model is defined in `data-model.md`.
2.  **API Contracts**: N/A for this project as it is a single HTML file.
3.  **Test Scenarios**: Manual test scenarios are defined in `quickstart.md`.

**Output**: data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks for creating the `index.html` file with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Estimated Output**: 3-5 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
