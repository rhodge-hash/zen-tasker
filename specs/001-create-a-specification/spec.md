# Feature Specification: Zen Tasker

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-specification`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a specification for a simple web-based task manager called \"Zen Tasker.\" The app should be a single-page application with a minimalist user interface. Features should include: - A user can add a new task using a text input field and a button. - A user can mark a task as complete by clicking on it, which visually strikes through the text. - A user can delete a task by clicking a delete button."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage a simple list of tasks so that I can keep track of what I need to do.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the task list is empty, **When** I enter "Buy milk" into the new task input and click "Add", **Then** "Buy milk" appears in the task list.
2. **Given** the task "Buy milk" is in the task list, **When** I click on "Buy milk", **Then** the text "Buy milk" is struck through.
3. **Given** the task "Buy milk" is in the task list, **When** I click the delete button for that task, **Then** "Buy milk" is removed from the task list.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add an empty task?
- What happens when a user tries to add a very long task?
